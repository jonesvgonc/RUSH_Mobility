RUSH Mobility is a plugin project to make a mobility system rig agnostic, you will depends on the IKs on your rig to make it works. It's in the start, but in some months we will have some good things on the project.

TO the good Souls with animation Skills, we have a folder with some rough base animations and a Unreal rig, if someone with animation skills want to help me, can you create netter animations to the project, I am only a developer with small skills on animation and modeling.
